# Chess-Network-Analysis
 
This repository is a combination of my efforts to understand chess instandard ways (reading some books and explaining each move) and also i aim to add some interesting network analysis for chess. I want to see for instance how the network connectivity changes both for white and black, to see if this has some relation to the winning chances of a player.
